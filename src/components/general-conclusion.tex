\section*{General Conclusion}
Throughout my internship at Navoy, I successfully modernized the AI travel platform by designing and implementing a practical cloud architecture that leverages Azure for development support and AWS for production deployment. The implementation involved migrating from a monolithic architecture to a scalable microservices ecosystem with comprehensive security, monitoring, and DevSecOps capabilities.

This project allowed me to expand my expertise in network engineering while learning cutting-edge cloud technologies such as AWS EKS, VPC architecture, application load balancing, network security implementation, and comprehensive monitoring frameworks. The experience has been invaluable for applying my theoretical knowledge from the Higher Institute of Technological Studies of Nabeul in real-world infrastructure scenarios.

The Navoy team's encouragement of learning and experimentation created an excellent environment for professional growth. I am grateful to have been recruited as a permanent team member.

Future improvements could include implementing enhanced monitoring with AI-powered network optimization and expanding the platform's global reach through additional AWS regions. This internship has prepared me to continue contributing significantly to the network engineering field.
