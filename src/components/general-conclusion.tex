\section*{General Conclusion}
Throughout my internship at Navoy, I successfully modernized the AI travel platform by designing and implementing a sophisticated multi-cloud network architecture spanning both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. The implementation involved migrating from a monolithic architecture to a scalable microservices ecosystem with advanced networking, security, and monitoring capabilities.

This project allowed me to expand my expertise in network engineering while learning cutting-edge cloud technologies such as Azure ExpressRoute, AWS Direct Connect, cross-cloud VPN connectivity, global load balancing, CDN implementation, and comprehensive network security frameworks. The experience has been invaluable for applying my theoretical knowledge from the Higher Institute of Technological Studies of Nabeul in real-world network infrastructure scenarios.

The Navoy team's encouragement of learning and experimentation created an excellent environment for professional growth. I am grateful to have been recruited as a permanent team member.

Future improvements could include implementing SD-WAN solutions for enhanced cross-cloud connectivity and expanding the network monitoring capabilities with AI-powered network optimization. This internship has prepared me to continue contributing significantly to the network engineering field.
