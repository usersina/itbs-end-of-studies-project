\section*{General Introduction}
The travel industry is experiencing unprecedented growth post-pandemic, with companies seeking AI solutions for personalized travel experiences. Modern travel technology companies must embrace DevSecOps principles to handle fluctuating demand and deliver continuous value.

My End of Studies Project modernizes Navoy's AI travel platform, transforming it from monolithic to microservices architecture. The current deployment has reached scalability limits due to increasing demand and real-time travel data processing requirements.

My mission involves decomposing the platform into independently scalable microservices while implementing a fully automated DevSecOps pipeline with security scanning, automated testing, and continuous monitoring. This ensures code changes are validated and deployed to production with zero downtime.

The infrastructure leverages cloud-native technologies and self-managed Kubernetes clusters, providing flexibility for varying loads and external travel API integration.

This report contains four chapters: introducing the project framework and host company; defining concepts and technical choices; analyzing functional and non-functional requirements; and presenting implementation details including hardware setup, deployment process, and DevSecOps practices.
