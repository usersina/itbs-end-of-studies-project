\section{DevSecOps}

\subsection{Definition}
DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It's an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle \cite{redhat-devsecops}. Unlike traditional approaches where security is treated as a separate phase, DevSecOps embeds security considerations from the initial design through deployment and maintenance. This approach is particularly crucial for travel technology platforms like Navoy's, where sensitive user data, payment information, and booking details must be protected throughout the entire development and deployment process.

The core addittion of DevSecOps over DevOps is "security as code," meaning that security policies, compliance checks, and vulnerability assessments are automated and integrated directly into CI/CD pipelines. This ensures that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of the development process, enabling faster and more secure releases.

\subsection{DevSecOps Lifecycle}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \makebox[\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{src/assets/images/devsecops-lifecycle.png}}
    \caption{DevSecOps Lifecycle}
    \label{fig:devops-lifecycle}
\end{figure}

The DevSecOps lifecycle consists of several key phases that integrate security seamlessly into development operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Plan}: Security requirements and threat modeling are incorporated during the planning phase
    \item \textbf{Code}: Secure coding practices and static application security testing (SAST) are applied
    \item \textbf{Build}: Security scanning and dependency vulnerability checks are automated
    \item \textbf{Test}: Dynamic application security testing (DAST) and penetration testing are performed
    \item \textbf{Deploy}: Infrastructure security scans and compliance checks are executed
    \item \textbf{Monitor}: Continuous security monitoring and incident response are maintained
\end{itemize}

For Navoy's AI travel platform, this lifecycle ensures that security vulnerabilities are caught early, reducing the risk of exposing sensitive travel data and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.

\subsection{Container Security}
Container security is a critical aspect of DevSecOps, especially when deploying microservices architectures. It involves securing the entire container lifecycle from image creation to runtime.

\subsubsection*{What is container security?}
Container security is the process of safeguarding containerized applications from malware and other vulnerabilities \cite{redhat-container-security}. This includes securing container images, the container runtime, and the orchestration platform. Key aspects include vulnerability scanning of base images, implementing least-privilege access controls, and continuous monitoring of container behavior.

\subsubsection*{Security scanning in CI/CD}
CI/CD security is the distribution of security practices and measures throughout the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline \cite{paloalto-cicd-security}. This includes scanning container images for known vulnerabilities, checking dependencies for security issues, and performing static code analysis. For Navoy's platform, this ensures that no vulnerable components are deployed to production, maintaining the security of the travel booking system.

\subsection{Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security}

\subsubsection*{What is IaC?}
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the ability to provision and support your computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes and settings. Any application environment requires many infrastructure components like operating systems, database connections, and storage. Developers have to regularly set up, update, and maintain the infrastructure to develop, test, and deploy applications \cite{aws-iac}.

\subsubsection*{Importance of IaC}
IaC ensures high availability by enabling rapid infrastructure replication and scaling across multiple regions. It enhances disaster recovery capabilities by allowing infrastructure to be quickly recreated from code in case of failures, ensuring business continuity for critical systems like Navoy's platform. Additionally, IaC reduces human error, improves consistency, and enables faster deployment cycles across multiple cloud providers.

\subsubsection*{IaC Security Best Practices}
IaC security involves applying security best practices to infrastructure definitions and ensuring cloud resources are configured securely by default. This includes scanning IaC templates for misconfigurations, implementing policy as code, and maintaining compliance with security standards throughout the provisioning process.

\section{AI Technologies for Trip Generation}

\subsection{Large Language Models (LLMs)}
Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep learning models trained on vast corpora of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Architecturally, most state-of-the-art LLMs are based on the Transformer model \cite{vaswani2017attention}, which leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies in text. These models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for specific tasks, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications such as text generation, summarization, translation, and question answering \cite{brown2020language, touvron2023llama}.

The core technology powering Navoy's AI-driven trip generation capabilities is the LLM. These models can interpret natural language inputs from users describing their travel preferences and generate personalized itineraries with contextual recommendations for destinations, activities, accommodations, and dining options. The ability of LLMs to process unstructured user requests and transform them into structured, actionable travel plans is a significant advancement in AI-driven travel technology \cite{bommasani2021opportunities}.

Recent research highlights the effectiveness of LLMs in understanding context, maintaining coherence over long conversations, and adapting to user-specific requirements \cite{openai2023gpt4, zhao2023survey}. For travel technology platforms like Navoy's, this means LLMs can deliver highly personalized and conversational experiences that align with modern user expectations for AI assistants.

\subsection{Model Selection and Integration}
The choice of LLM provider and integration approach is crucial for maintaining both quality and reliability in AI-powered travel recommendations.

\subsection{AI Models: OpenAI GPT vs Claude}
For AI-powered trip generation, selecting the right language model and integration approach is critical for delivering high-quality, personalized travel recommendations.

        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{LiteLLM Integration Approach}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \makebox[\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=12cm]{src/assets/images/litellm.png}}
    \caption{LiteLLM}
    \label{fig:litellm}
\end{figure}

For Navoy's AI travel platform, I chose to implement LiteLLM as the primary integration solution. According to its official description, LiteLLM is an "LLM Gateway to provide model access, fallbacks and spend tracking across 100+ LLMs. All in the same API"\cite{litellm}. It acts as a proxy service that provides a unified interface to access multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others through a single API.

The key advantages of using LiteLLM include enabling model switching without code changes, cost optimization through provider comparison, fallback mechanisms for reliability, and unified monitoring across all models. It serves as a simple drop-in replacement for OpenAI API calls while supporting load balancing, rate limiting, and providing comprehensive logging and analytics.

This approach allows organic access to both OpenAI's GPT models and Claude, providing flexibility to use the best model for specific tasks—GPT for creative itinerary generation and Claude for detailed travel advice—while maintaining a unified codebase and enabling cost optimization through intelligent model routing.

% ----------------------- Cloud Infrastructure and Network Architecture ----------------------- %
\section{Cloud Infrastructure and Network Architecture}

\subsection{Multi-Cloud Network Design}
Modern travel platforms require robust, scalable network infrastructure that can handle global traffic patterns and ensure low-latency access to AI services. The network architecture must support microservices communication, secure data transmission, and efficient traffic routing across multiple cloud regions.

For Navoy's AI travel platform, the network design encompasses VPC architecture, subnet segmentation, load balancing strategies, CDN implementation, and cross-cloud connectivity. This infrastructure supports both the distributed microservices architecture and the AI model serving requirements while maintaining security and performance standards.

\subsection{Network Security and Compliance}
Network security is paramount for travel platforms handling sensitive user data, payment information, and booking details. The architecture must implement defense-in-depth strategies including network segmentation, traffic encryption, DDoS protection, and compliance with international data protection regulations.

The network security framework includes firewall configurations, security groups, network access control lists, VPN gateways for secure connectivity, and monitoring systems for threat detection and response. These components work together to create a comprehensive security posture that protects both infrastructure and application layers.

\subsection{Cloud Providers: Azure vs AWS}

\section{Comparative Analysis}
In order to modernize Navoy's AI travel platform and implement proper DevSecOps practices, I need a wide range of tools that deal with the following areas: version control, container orchestration, infrastructure as code, and automated testing. For that, I conducted a comparative study on some of the tools the market provides.

\subsection{Version Control: GitLab vs GitHub}
Modern DevSecOps relies on robust version control for collaboration and code management. GitLab and GitHub are leading platforms based on Git, supporting change tracking, branching, and team workflows. While both offer similar core features—like pull/merge requests and code review—they differ in their approach to DevOps integration.

The table below compares their version control and DevSecOps integration:

        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

For Navoy's infrastructure, I chose Terraform due to its maturity, provider ecosystem, and the team's familiarity with HCL. Its robust state management and industry adoption make it ideal for managing complex, scalable cloud environments.

\subsection{Deployment: Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes}

\subsubsection*{Container Orchestration}
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications \cite{docker-compose} and whilte it is great for local development and testing, but it is not suitable for production. It lacks high availability, automated failover, rolling updates, and dynamic scaling. Without features like native service discovery, self-healing, or advanced networking, Compose cannot reliably manage complex, distributed applications at scale. Using it in production can result in downtime and manual intervention.

For production, container orchestration is essential. Tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm automate deployment, scaling, and management of containers across clusters. Kubernetes stands out for its self-healing, auto-scaling, declarative configuration, and large ecosystem. While Docker Compose can define multi-container apps, it lacks the automation, resilience, and scalability needed for cloud-native workloads. Moving to Kubernetes or a similar orchestrator ensures reliability and maintainability.

Our research led us to compare Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

\end{table}
Therefore, we will be deploying our application stack to Kubernetes since the potential is huge compared to the deprecated Docker Swarm.

\subsection{Automated Testing: Jest vs Playwright}
Automated testing is crucial for DevSecOps pipelines, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions. For Navoy's platform, both unit testing and end-to-end testing are essential.

\begin{table}[H]
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
    \caption{Comparative study between Jest and Playwright}
    \centering
    \medskip
    \begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth} {
            | >{\hsize=.7\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\centering\arraybackslash}X
            | >{\hsize=1.15\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\justifying\arraybackslash}X
            | >{\hsize=1.15\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\justifying\arraybackslash}X |}
        \hline
        \rowcolor{primary} \textbf {Aspect} & \textbf {Jest}                                                                                                                          & \textbf {Playwright}                                                                                                       \\
        \hline
        \textbf {Testing Type}              & \noindent Unit testing framework for testing components, functions, and modules in isolation. Excels at business logic and API testing. & \noindent End-to-end testing framework supporting multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) for cross-browser testing. \\
        \hline
        \textbf {Performance}               & \noindent Fast parallel test execution with built-in mocking and snapshot testing.                                                      & \noindent Fast and reliable with automatic waiting, parallel execution, and test isolation.                                \\
        \hline
        \textbf {DevSecOps Integration}     & \noindent Seamless CI/CD integration with coverage reports and build failure on threshold violations.                                   & \noindent Excellent CI/CD integration with Docker support and automatic screenshot/video capture on failures.              \\
        \hline
        \textbf {Browser Support}           & \noindent Focuses on unit testing, can use jsdom for DOM testing.                                                                       & \noindent Supports all modern browsers for comprehensive cross-browser testing.                                            \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

For Navoy's platform, I chose to implement both Jest for comprehensive unit testing of microservices and business logic, and Playwright for end-to-end testing of critical user journeys like trip planning and booking flows. This combination ensures both code quality and user experience validation across multiple browsers.

\subsection{Deployment management: Kubectl vs Helm}
Since we're using Kubernetes, we have the option to deploy our microservices either with Kubectl or with Helm.
\begin{table}[H]
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}%
    \caption{Comparative study between Kubectl and Helm}
    \centering
    \medskip
    \begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth} {
            | >{\hsize=.7\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\centering\arraybackslash}X
            | >{\hsize=1.15\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\justifying\arraybackslash}X
            | >{\hsize=1.15\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\justifying\arraybackslash}X |}
        \hline
        \rowcolor{primary} \textbf {Aspect} & \textbf{Kubectl}                                                                                                                            & \textbf{Helm}                                                                                                                              \\
        \hline
        \textbf {Overview}                  & \noindent The official Kubernetes command-line tool for running commands against clusters.                                                  & \noindent The package manager for Kubernetes applications.                                                                                 \\
        \hline
        \textbf {Capabilities}              & \noindent Deploy applications, manage cluster resources, view logs, and advanced features like node tainting and load balancing strategies. & \noindent Define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications with templates to avoid code duplication between similar resources. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}
Thoroughly studying our use case, we agreed to create a uniform Helm package to ship our microservices.
We also deemed it necessary to have some common configuration that we simply apply with Kubectl such as Ingress rules or letsencrypt certificates for convenience purposes and due to the lack of time.
